# Samuel Narvaez - Capstone 1 proposals

## Proposal 1: 
### Exploring the CDC's Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI):
  https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#pandemic-vulnerability-index

  https://github.com/COVID19PVI/data

  https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf/data

#### Dataset
I think it could be interesting to unpack the distributions of the data that go into the making of this index. The index is comprised of various Data domains that are all weighted by a percent as outlined here: https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/coronavirus/covid19pvi/details/. I would like to further explore some of the datapoints that themselves are the result of a lot of analysis. For example the Unacast Social Distancing scoreboard tracks people's social distancing through changes in average distance traveled. I don't think their source data is accessible, as it seems like a lot of individual user gps locations. Although a few of the data domains that go into the index are results of analysis like the Social Distancing data, the majority of it seems to be less proccessed. 
#### Possible Visualizations
I think it could be interesting to choose a few days and compare the correlations between COVID deaths and all the individual variables that go into the PVI as well as the PVI itself AND correlations between COVID infections and all the individual variables that go into the PVI as well as the PVI itself. 
#### Possible Hypotheses to test: 
Could test to confirm that the PVI is a better predictor for COVID infections and deaths than any of the individual datapoints on their own 
## Proposal 2: 
### Spotify
https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks

#### Dataset
 A dataset containing numerical and categorical attributes of over 175000 songs from spotify.  
#### Possible Visualizations
Could compare the average change in attributes like instrumentalness and danceability over time, could find correlations between popularity and other attributes.
#### Possible Hypotheses to test: 
does tempo affect popularity of a song? How about instrumentalness?
## Proposal 3: 
### Kickstarter Projects
https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects?select=ks-projects-201801.csv
#### Dataset
data from kickstarter including funding goals, funding fulfilled, etc. 
#### Possible Visualizations
Could visualize how many kickstarters get different percentiles of their goals met
Could visualize how many successful kickstarters there are by category, length of funding window, year, etc. 
#### Possible Hypotheses to test: 
Were there some years that kickstarters were in general more successful?
Are certain categories of kickstarter more likely to be funded?
