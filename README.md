# Samuel Narvaez - Capstone 1 proposals

## Proposal 1: 
### Exploring the CDC's Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI):

  https://github.com/COVID19PVI/data

  https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf/data

#### Dataset
I think it could be interesting to unpack the distributions of the data that go into the making of this index. The index is comprised of various Data domains that are all weighted by a percent as outlined here: https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/coronavirus/covid19pvi/details/. I would like to further explore some of the datapoints that themselves are the result of a lot of analysis. For example the Unacast Social Distancing scoreboard tracks people's social distancing through changes in average distance traveled. I don't think their source data is accessible, as it seems like a lot of individual user gps locations. Although a few of the data domains that go into the index are results of analysis like the Social Distancing data, the majority of it seems to be less proccessed. 
#### Possible Visualizations
I think it could be interesting to choose a few days and compare the correlations between COVID deaths and all the individual variables that go into the PVI as well as the PVI itself AND correlations between COVID infections and all the individual variables that go into the PVI as well as the PVI itself. 
#### Possible Hypotheses to test: 
Could test to confirm that the PVI is a better predictor for COVID infections and deaths than any of the individual datapoints on their own
